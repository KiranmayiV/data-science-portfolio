# Portfolio - Data Science and Complex Systems
This Repository contains academic research projects and assignment projects pursured as part of my PhD coursework in Computational Biology,my degree in Complex Systems at University of Sydney along with a few personal data science projects. 

 The projects persented here cover skills and tools used both in Data Science and/or Complex Adaptive Systems and Computtaional Biology ie Linear and Non Linear Systems simulations and algorithms.

## MATLAB & Computational Biology
While I was a PhD candidate, I wrote some complex simulation algorithms in MATLAB which mostly fell in the domain of Modelling Biological Systems such as - pattern matching of DNA sequences, stochastic process modelling of reaction-diffusion, DNA alignment etc. I have uploaded some of the algorithms here - 
1. [Gibbs Sampling and Simulated Annaling](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Gibbs%20Sampling%20%26%20SA) 
2. [Gillespie Algorithm for modelling stochastic processes](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Gillespie%20Algorithm%20-%20stochastic%20processes)
3. [Markov Model](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Markov%20Model)
4. [Hidden Markov Model](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Hidden%20Markov%20Model%20-%20Viterbi)

## Complex Adaptive Systems
After my decision to discontinue with my PhD I decided I wanted a change in field and to move away from Biological Systems. Instead I came to University of Sydney to purse Masters in Complex Adaptive Systems. 

[Complex Adaptive Systems](https://fs.blog/2014/04/mental-model-complex-adaptive-systems/) has its roots in modeling non linear dynamical systems. Originatin from the study of interacting parts of a system in a non linear fashion it was found that when such systems are simulated and the simulation played out for long periods, the interacting particles would give rise to system level phenomena such as emergent patterns of oscillations. While individual particles in themselves had no 'brain' so to say, together and on the whole they displayed complex behaviour eg - school of fish, flocks of birds, neurons that sync to fire together etc. 

Below are some of the projects related to CAS - 
1. [Spread of Salmonellosis in NSW](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Spread%20of%20Salmonellosis%20in%20NSW) (work in progress) **<em>Python</em>**
2. Cellular Automaton (coming soon) **<em>MATLAB</em>**
3. Random Boolean Networks (coming soon) **<em>MATLAB</em>**
4. Differential Equations in XPPAuto (coming soon) 

## Machine Learning/ Data Science
Lately I have also been trying my hand in a few machine learning projects and data science projects. Herein below are listed some of the projects -

1. [AmesHousing Assignment](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/AmesHousing%20Assignment) **<em>R</em>**
2. [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Simple%20Linear%20Regression) **<em>R</em>**
3. [Kaggle](/Kaggle) - I made this folder to document my Kaggle kernels. 
**<em>R</em>**
4. Bike Sharing Demand (coming soon) **<em>R</em>**
5. Ground Water Sources in India (coming soon) **<em>Python</em>**

## Geospatial Data Science
While I was at University of Sydney, I did this unit on Applied GIS and Spatial Analytics. For better or worse, I fell in love with spatial analytics. I have decided to do more of geospatial projects from now on so expect this section to see more projects in coming months. But so far here are the porjects listed below - 

1. [WiFi Based Huma Movement Patterns](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Wifi%20Based%20Human%20Movement%20Patterns) (coming soon) **<em>R</em>**
2. [Spread of Salmonellosis in NSW](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Spread%20of%20Salmonellosis%20in%20NSW) (work in progress) **<em>Python</em>**
