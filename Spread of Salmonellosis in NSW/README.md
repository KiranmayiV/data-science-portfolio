# Studying the Spread of Salmonellosis in NSW
This folder contains the code and analysis of the project carried about in collaboration with Charles Perkins Centre and Centre for Complex Systems at the University of Sydney. 
The project has multiple team members each of whom had uniquely contributed to the project. 

While the project has been published as linked [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42582-3), this folder only inlcudes the work done by the author and doesn't include the work of other authors of the paper.

To open notebook in binder [click here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/fba4d56bdea9ae0e71353574ff81c9053d0ed711?filepath=Spread%20of%20Salmonellosis%20in%20NSW%2Fgeospatial%20data.ipynb).

Included here is also a self contained [python script](./bokeh_app/common_strain.py) for the geospatial visualisation hosted as a bokeh dashboard - to be displayed locally.
How to run bokeh dashboard:
1. Download the bokeh_app folder.
2. From the terminal navigate to inside the bokeh_app folder.
3. Use command bokeh serve --show common_strain.py to host the dashboard locally.
