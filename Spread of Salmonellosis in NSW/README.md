# Studying the Spread of Salmonellosis in NSW
This folder contains the code and analysis of the project carried about in collaboration with Charles Perkins Centre and Centre for Complex Systems at the University of Sydney. 
The project has multiple team members each of whom had uniquely contributed to the project. 

While the project has been published as linked [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42582-3), this folder only inlcudes the work done by the author and doesn't include the work of other authors of the paper.
